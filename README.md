# NLTK-projects

## Overview
Welcome to the "NLTK-projects" repository! This repository focuses on exploring and implementing a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using the NLTK library and other tools. Our projects cover a wide range of applications, from sentiment analysis and text classification to language generation and feature engineering.

## Projects

### DL for NLP
- **Description**: This project explores the application of Deep Learning in Natural Language Processing, demonstrating how advanced neural network architectures can be used to process and understand natural language data.

### DL NLP for Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
- **Description**: A detailed study on sentiment analysis of movie reviews using deep learning techniques. This project aims to accurately determine the sentiment conveyed in movie reviews by applying state-of-the-art NLP methods.

### ELIZA
- **Description**: A modern adaptation of the classic ELIZA program, showcasing the early methods of natural language processing and conversation simulation in a contemporary context.

### TFIDF & Cosine Similarity
- **Description**: Implementation and exploration of TFIDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and cosine similarity for advanced text analysis, focusing on the extraction of meaningful insights from textual data.

### Autocomplete
- **Description**: This project develops a simple word autocomplete/autocorrect system, demonstrating the principles of word probability and predictive text input in NLP.

### Bigram Models
- **Description**: An exploration into bigram models, showcasing how two consecutive words in text can be used to build probabilistic language models and understand language structure.

### Feature Engineering with Scikit-Learn
- **Description**: Demonstrates feature engineering in NLP using scikit-learn's pipeline and modeling tools, focusing on how to effectively transform and utilize textual data for machine learning.

### Language Generation Using N-gram Model
- **Description**: This project delves into language generation using an n-gram model, illustrating how statistical models can be used to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.

### Naive Bayes Text Classifier
- **Description**: Focuses on text classification using the Naive Bayes algorithm, a fundamental approach in NLP for categorizing text into predefined classes based on its content.

### Text Classification - Naive Bayes
- **Description**: Applies the Naive Bayes classifier to analyze tweets related to the coronavirus, including detailed evaluation metrics like confusion matrix and accuracy scores.

### Word Embeddings
- **Description**: Investigates the use of word embeddings in conjunction with logistic regression for NLP tasks, highlighting how vector representations of words can enhance machine learning models.
